# Master Thesis Analysis Code (2022)

This repository contains the analysis code used for my 2022 master's thesis. The project includes several statistical models and survival analyses to investigate factors impacting venture capital portfolio performance. **The repository is uploaded for demonstration purposes only**. All original source data has been excluded, and all variables and company identifiers have been anonymized.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the following analytical methods:

- **Logistic Regression**: To predict performance outcomes based on various KPIs.
- **Survival Analysis (Time to Event Analysis)**: To analyze the timing of certain events within the portfolio.
- **Kaplan-Meier Curve**: To visualize the probability of event-free survival over time.
- **Cox Proportional Hazards Regression**: To examine the effect of covariates on the time to event.
- **Factor Analysis**: To identify underlying factors that influence observable variables, reducing dimensionality and uncovering latent structures in the data.
